# Qwicker

**TL;DR**
- choose **Qwickly (Mod B)** as the easiest to learn layout from QWERTY (over NIRO/Colemak-likes or Dvorak)
- choose **Qwicker (Mod R)** for mixed mechanical and laptop keyboard use as easier to learn than Colemak and faster for prose
- choose **Qwicker (Mod HR)** for mechanical keyboard use as easier to learn than Colemak and faster for prose

Qwickly and Qwicker have been designed for typing english prose. Benchmarks for word lists or other languages was not a factor.

## Qwickly (Mod B)

## Qwicker (aka KFLY)

## Qwicker (Mod H)

This layout merely swaps `H` and `F` on the Qwicker layout. It is better to type on with mechanical keyboards, but with more hand movement on a laptop keyboard as fingers don't strike straight down (instead splayed with a tap motion). If predominantly using a mechanical keyboard this is recommended.

## Qwicker (Mod R)

After using `Qwicker (aka KFLY)` on both a mechanical keyboard and MacBook Pro built-in keyboard for many months I was able to type quickly but the right hand still felt unsmooth typing certain words. After some experimentation settled on the 'Mod R' flavour which has more 'inward' rolling key sequences and less 'outward' rolling ones.

## Qwicker (Mod HR)

Not shown but of course swapping the `H` and `F` keys of the 'Mod R' layout would result in a 'Mod HR' suitable for mechanical keyboards more than laptops.
