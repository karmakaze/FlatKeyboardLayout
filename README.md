This layout was made as an experiment to see how good the metrics could be.<br/>
It sacrifices some shortcut key positions and moves more keys to different fingers/hands from QWERTY for marginal gains and is not generally recommended. It you really want that last bit of performance, MTGAP is a better choice.

The **Qwicker** layout is recommended for everyone wanting a Colemak-like layout with the best ergonomics/performance for english text. Although Colemak (Mod DH) has better metrics than Qwicker, there is less use of the bottom row on Qwicker which means less hand movement. Thls is especially true on laptop keyboards (or other low profile/key-travel types) and is a strongly recommended choice if a fair percentage of typing is done on them.

The **[Qwickly](https://github.com/qwickly-org/Qwickly)** layout offers great ergonomics/performance while being the easiest to learn coming from QWERTY.<br/>
Due to their similarity, it is reasonable to first try the Qwickly (and its transitional layouts) for a while then after getting a sense of the improvements (and possibly any noticeable drawbacks) choose the one to learn to type best on.
