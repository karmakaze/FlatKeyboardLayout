# Qwicker

**TL;DR**
- choose **Qwickly (Mod B)** as the easiest to learn layout from QWERTY (over NIRO/Colemak-likes or Dvorak)
- choose **Qwicker (Mod R)** for mixed mechanical and laptop keyboard use as easier to learn than Colemak and faster for prose
- choose **Qwicker (Mod H)** for least finger movement and easier to learn than Colemak and faster for prose

Qwickly and Qwicker have been designed for typing English prose. Benchmarks for word lists or other languages was not a factor.

## Qwickly (Mod B)

## Qwicker (aka KFLY)
The first draft of the Qwicker layouts had `N` `R` `I` `O` ([image](https://github.com/qwickly-org/Qwicker/blob/master/Qwicker.png)) on the right hand home keys. It was a false start or failed experiment that led to the Mod-R and Mod-H layouts.

## Qwicker (Mod R)

After using `Qwicker (aka KFLY)` on both a mechanical keyboard and MacBook Pro built-in keyboard for many months I was able to type quickly but the right hand still felt unsmooth typing certain words. After some experimentation settled on the 'Mod R' flavour which has more 'inward' rolling key sequences and less 'outward' rolling ones.

## Qwicker (Mod H)

This layout merely rotate-swaps `H`, `M`, and `B` on the Qwicker-R layout. It is the most optimized of all the Qwicker layouts and recommended although it changes a few more key positions from QWERTY.
